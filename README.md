# HiddenPhox
HiddenPhox is a kitchen sink bot of sorts providing utilities, moderation tools and fun.

**I am not getting anything out of having HiddenPhox on bot lists and have decided to go semi-private.**

I will still have the invite command avaliable and linked [right here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=173441062243663872&scope=bot), but those will be the only public places to get them.
I just find bot lists a waste of time and resources more than anything.

Also yes, bot collection server detection will still exist.
